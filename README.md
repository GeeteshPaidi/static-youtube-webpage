# youtube_frontend
This is my first project in web development.
This project is a small webpage of youtube frontend.
It is built using HTML and CSS basics.
It uses youtube to fetch the videos.
You can see its html code and css code in the respective files.
The css code is seperated with comments based on their work area.
Semantic elements are also used for better understanding of the code.

Features of the project:
    a. All the icons have hover shade effect.
    b. The videos are playable on clicking them.
    c. There are both light and dark mode and can be accessed by clicking the icon.
    d. Screen resize reduces(or increases) the number of videos in a row.
    e. The header and sidebar are fixed and don't move along with the page.
